package histogram

// FloatHistogram is similar to Histogram but uses float64 for all
// counts. Additionally, bucket counts are absolute and not deltas.
//
// A FloatHistogram is needed by PromQL to handle operations that might result
// in fractional counts. Since the counts in a histogram are unlikely to be too
// large to be represented precisely by a float64, a FloatHistogram can also be
// used to represent a histogram with integer counts and thus serves as a more
// generalized representation.

	// Currently valid schema numbers are -4 <= n <= 8.  They are all for
	// base-2 bucket schemas, where 1 is a bucket boundary in each case, and
	// then each power of two is divided into 2^n logarithmic buckets.  Or
	// in other words, each bucket boundary is the previous boundary times
	// 2^(2^-n).
